# Overview
This in-class exercise note aims to share with ways to handle aspatial and geospatial data that might be useful when you work on Take-home Exercise 2. By the end of this in-class exercise, you will be able to:

import geospatial data in wkt format into R,

convert the tibble data frame with wkt field into sf data frame, and

performing point-in-polygon overlay.

# Getting Started
As usual, to get started, we will load the necessary R packages. For the purpose of this in-class exercise, three R packages will be used, they are:

sf for importing and processing geospatial data,

tidyverse for importing and processing non-spatial data. In this exercise, readr package will be used for importing wkt data and dplyr package will be used to wrangling the data.
```{r}
pacman::p_load(sf, tidyverse)
```

# Data Import
In this in-class exercise, two data sets will be used. They are:
## Importing water point data
First, we are going to import the water point data into R environment.
